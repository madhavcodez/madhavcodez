- **DevOps & Cloud:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB), Git/GitHub
- **Methodologies:** Agile (Scrum), Unit/Integration Testing, Peer Reviews, RESTful API Development

## üöÄ Featured Projects
- **Inventory Tracking System (Hope Restored Missions):**  
  Developed a full-stack solution using Nuxt.js, Vue.js, TypeScript, Prisma, Node.js, and C to reduce manual inventory tracking errors by 40%.  
- **Smart Home Security System:**  
  Built a real-time facial recognition and object detection platform using Python (OpenCV), C++, Docker, and a Jetson Nano for low-latency computer vision pipelines.  
- **Rajputra.Org (RANA):**  
  Modernized a legacy website using Angular, CSS, and MySQL, implementing secure user authentication and boosting user engagement through a responsive interface.
