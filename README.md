# Hi there, I'm Madhav! üëã

**Computer Science Junior** | **Problem Solver** | **Tech Explorer**

I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science (Expected 2026) at The University of Texas at Dallas. I enjoy learning about **different technologies**, tackling **challenging problems**, and building projects that make an impact.

## üîß Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, Java, C/C++, TypeScript, JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** React, Angular, Node.js, Next.js, TensorFlow Lite
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, DynamoDB
- **DevOps/Cloud:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB), Git/GitHub
- **General Practices:** Agile (Scrum), Testing (Unit/Integration), Peer Reviews, REST API Development

## üöÄ Projects
- **Inventory Tracking System (Hope Restored Missions)**  
  Built a full-stack solution with Nuxt.js, Vue.js, TypeScript, Prisma, Node.js, and C.

- **Smart Home Security System**  
  Created a real-time detection platform using Python (OpenCV), TensorFlow Lite, C++ for edge computing.

- **Rajputra.Org (RANA)**  
  Refreshed an existing community portal with Angular and Spring Boot, integrating secure user access and improved data workflows.

- **SoundScore**  
  Developed a social music rating app with React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Spotify API for real-time album interactions.
